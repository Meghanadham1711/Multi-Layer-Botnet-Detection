# Multi-Layer Botnet Attack Detection in IoT Environment

This project implements a multi-layer botnet attack detection system using
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Random Forest to enhance detection accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Deep Learning (DNN)
- Random Forest
- UNSW-NB15 Dataset

## Features
- Detects botnet attacks from network traffic
- Uses ensemble learning for better accuracy
- Flask-based backend integration

## Dataset
UNSW-NB15 dataset is used for training and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `python app.py`
3. Open browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
